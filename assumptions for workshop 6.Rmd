## Exercise 6: Check Model Assumptions

For this type of design, we can check normality of residuals and homogeneity of variance (similar to a one-way ANOVA for an independent measures design).

Use the code below to generate plots to visually inspect the data and use statistical tests to check these two assumptions.

You should decide if the assumptions of normality and homogeneity were met.

```r
library(performance) # might need installing if on your own device.

#Normality plots
check_model(mod)
check_normality(mod)

#Homogeneity of variance
check_homogeneity(mod, method = "levene")
plot(check_homogeneity(mod, method = "levene"))
```

If you experience issues with displaying the plots above using the `performance` package, here is some alternative code which will do the same.

```r
# testing normality, looking at normal distribution of residuals from the model.
residuals <- residuals(mod) #pulls residuals from the model
qqPlot(residuals) #produces a qq-plot of residuals
hist(residuals, breaks = 20, main = "Histogram of Residuals", xlab = "Residuals", col = "lightblue") #histogram of residuals
shapiro.test(residuals) #Shapiro test for residuals

# testing homogeneity of variance
library(car)
leveneTest(anx ~ usage*notify, mydata)
